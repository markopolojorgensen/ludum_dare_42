Game Todo
  Running out of space

  boss takes away space from player somehow
    boss mines
    boss burns away area / destroys it somehow
    autoscroller? based on boss's health
    shrinking platforms / arena
    obstructed area: debris, etc
    boss physically expands
    screen space is obstructed, difficult to see the player
      virus
      fog / snow / precipitation
      cherry blossoms
  
  health packs to reward defensive players
    don't want to automatically restart when taking hits early

  player can reflect boss projectiles, easier with more space
    projectiles probably slow down as they move if that makes it easier to reflect them
      or just bigger window for reflecting them

  random stuff lying on the ground on the islands you can hit towards the boss.
